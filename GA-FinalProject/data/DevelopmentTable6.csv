"a. Not all indicators were available for all countries, so caution should be used in cross-country comparisons. Where an indicator is missing, weights of available indicators are adjusted to total 100 percent. See Technical note 5 at http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/hdr2016_technical_notes.pdf for details.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"b. D indicates data from Demographic and Health Surveys, M from Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys, P from Pan Arab Population and Family Health Survey and N from national surveys (see http://hdr.undp.org/en/faq-page/multidimensional-poverty-index-mpi for the list of national surveys).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Definitions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Multidimensional Poverty Index: Percentage of the population that is multidimensionally poor adjusted by the intensity of the deprivations. See Technical note 5 at http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/hdr2016_technical_notes.pdf for details on how the Multidimensional Poverty Index is calculated.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Multidimensional poverty headcount: Percentage of the population with a deprivation score of at least 33 percent. It is also expressed in thousands of the population in the survey year.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Intensity of deprivation of multidimensional poverty: Average deprivation score experienced by people in multidimensional poverty.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Population near multidimensional poverty: Percentage of the population at risk of suffering multiple deprivations—that is, those with a deprivation score of 20–33 percent.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Population in severe multidimensional poverty: Percentage of the population in severe multidimensional poverty—that is, those with a deprivation score of 50 percent or more.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Contribution of deprivation to overall poverty: Percentage of the Multidimensional Poverty Index attributed to deprivations in each dimension.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Population living below national poverty line: Percentage of the population living below the national poverty line, which is the poverty line deemed appropriate for a country by its authorities. National estimates are based on population-weighted subgroup estimates from household surveys.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Population living below PPP$1.90 a day: Percentage of the population living below the international poverty line $1.90 (in purchasing power parity terms) a day.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Main data sources,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
