,Gender Development Index: Ratio of female to male HDI values. See Technical note 3 at http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/hdr2016_technical_notes.pdf for details on how the Gender Development Index is calculated.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Gender Development Index groups: Countries are divided into five groups by absolute deviation from gender parity in HDI values. Group 1 comprises countries with high equality in HDI achievements between women and men (absolute deviation of less than 2.5 percent); group 2 comprises countries with medium to high equality in HDI achievements between women and men (absolute deviation of 2.5-5 percent); group 3 comprises countries with medium equality in HDI achievements between women and men (absolute deviation of 5-7.5 percent); group 4 comprises countries with medium to low equality in HDI achievements between women and men (absolute deviation of 7.5-10 percent); and group 5 comprises countries with low equality in HDI achievements between women and men (absolute deviation from gender parity of more than 10 percent).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Human Development Index (HDI): A composite index measuring average achievement in three basic dimensions of human development—a long and healthy life, knowledge and a decent standard of living. See Technical note 1 at http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/hdr2016_technical_notes.pdf  for details on how the HDI is calculated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Life expectancy at birth: Number of years a newborn infant could expect to live if prevailing patterns of age-specific mortality rates at the time of birth stay the same throughout the infant’s life.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Expected years of schooling: Number of years of schooling that a child of school entrance age can expect to receive if prevailing patterns of age-specific enrolment rates persist throughout the child’s life.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Mean years of schooling: Average number of years of education received by people ages 25 and older, converted from educational attainment levels using official durations of each level.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Estimated gross national income per capita: Derived from the ratio of female to male wages, female and male shares of economically active population and GNI (in 2011 purchasing power parity terms). See Technical note 3 at http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/hdr2016_technical_notes.pdf for details.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
