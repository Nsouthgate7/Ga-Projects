"a. Not all indicators were available for all countries, so caution should be used in cross-country comparisons. Where an indicator is missing, weights of available indicators are adjusted to total 100%. See Technical note 5 at http://hdr.undp.org for details.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"b. D indicates data from Demographic and Health Surveys, M indicates data from Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys, P indicates data from Pan Arab Population and Family Health Survey and N indicates data from national surveys (see http://hdr.undp.org for the list of national surveys).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
c. Missing indicator on electricity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
d. Missing indicator on child mortality.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Definitions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Multidimensional Poverty Index: Percentage of the population that is multidimensionally poor adjusted by the intensity of the deprivations. See Technical note 5 at http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/hdr2016_technical_notes.pdf for details on how the Multidimensional Poverty Index is calculated.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Multidimensional poverty headcount: Percentage of the population with a deprivation score of at least 33 percent. It is also expressed in thousands of the population in the survey year.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Intensity of deprivation of multidimensional poverty: Average deprivation score experienced by people in multidimensional poverty.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Population near multidimensional poverty: Percentage of the population at risk of suffering multiple deprivations—that is, those with a deprivation score of 20–33 percent.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Population in severe poverty: Percentage of the population in severe multidimensional poverty—that is, those with a deprivation score of 50 percent or more.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Contribution of deprivation to overall poverty: Percentage of the Multidimensional Poverty Index attributed to deprivations in each dimension.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
